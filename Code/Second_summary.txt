ðŸ“Œ **Meeting Summary** ðŸ“Œ

The AHA recommends a diet that emphasizes fish, poultry and plant-based proteins and limits red and processed meats. The amount of saturated fat in meats can vary widely, depending on the cut and how itâ€™s prepared. The simple cooking tips below will help you prepare tasty, heart-healthy meals. Choose white meat most often when eating poultry. Choose oily fish such as salmon, trout and herring, which are high in omega-3 fatty acids. Prepare fish baked, broiled, grilled or boiled rather than breaded and fried. Liquid vegetable oils such as canola, safflower, sunflower, soybean and olive oil can often be used instead of solid fats, such as butter, lard or shortening. Chopped parsley and chives, sprinkled on just before serving, can enhance the flavor of many vegetables. Low-fat (1%) or fat-free (skim) milk can be used in many recipes in place of whole milk or half-and-half. Substitute low-fat, low-sodium cottage cheese, part-skim milk mozzarella (or ricotta) cheese.
