In recent times, scammers and hackers have been approaching ordinary citizens, falsely
claiming to represent government agencies.
To protect the public from failing prey to such fraud, it would be beneficial for the
government to include a QR code-based system.
In this approach, each legitimate government officer could be assigned a unique QR code.
The general public would then be able to scan the code to verify whether the person
is genuine, confirm the legitimacy of the reported issues, and validate the authenticity
of any request or demand made.
This QR code system would provide a quick and easy way for citizens to differentiate
between real government officials and scammers, ensuring greater transparency and security
for the public.
